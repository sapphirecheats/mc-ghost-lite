# Information
Free open-source Java/Kotlin Minecraft client that comes with standard features, exclusive capabilities, and is easily expandable.

Officially compatible with 1.8.9 Forge.

**Note**: This project was originally written in early 2022 and was later scrapped and open sourced. 

We have no plans to update the client. Rather, our aim is to maintain it as an open resource for individuals interested in development. This allows users to study the code and gain insights into the development process while also offering a platform to build upon and customize according to their needs. By keeping the client open-source, we hope to foster a learning environment and encourage the sharing of knowledge within the community.

## Disclaimer
The client was developed without the primary intention of bypassing servers. Although it includes unique features, it will not receive updates or bug fixes. Instead, the focus is on providing an open resource for users to learn and build upon rather than offering a fully functional, consistently updated client.

Despite the client not being intended for bypassing servers or receiving updates, some of its modules may remain undetected permanently. Features such as Quick Accel, Fast Stop, Safe Walk, and our Adaptive AimAssist are examples of modules that are on par with or even surpass some of the paid alternatives available in the market. These modules offer a competitive edge while maintaining a low profile, ensuring an enhanced gaming experience without detection.
