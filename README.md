## About our other products
If you would like to try our paid software, check out our site [here](https://sapphire.ac) or our discord [here](https://discord.sapphire.ac).

All of our free software is developed with the community in mind to either supply free alternatives or a way to introduce new developers to a useful code environment. With that being said, we have to sustain ourselves so the free products we release are very limited so checking out our paid software is much appreciated.

## Disclaimer
This client was NOT written with the intent of fully bypassing servers, although it has unique features it is not going to get updates or bug fixes.

With that being said, some of the modules in it will likely remain undetected perminently, things like Quick Accel, Fast stop, Safe walk & Adaptive AimAssist are some of the features in the client that are caught up or even better than some paid alternatives on the market.
