## Disclaimer
This client was NOT written with the intent of fully bypassing servers, although it has unique features it is not going to get updates or bug fixes.

With that being said, some of the modules in it will likely remain undetected perminently, things like Quick Accel, Fast stop, Safe walk & Adaptive AimAssist are some of the features in the client that are caught up or even better than some paid alternatives on the market.
